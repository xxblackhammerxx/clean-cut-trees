              &ldquo;This is the third time we&apos;ve used Clean Cuts Trees, and once again, they
              delivered excellent service. Their response time was impressively fast, and they did a
              fantastic job at a very fair price. The work site was left spotless, which we really
              appreciated. Chaz, the job supervisor, was a pleasure to work with — professional,
              communicative, and made sure everything ran smoothly.&rdquo;

              &ldquo;First - the people. Zac and Laurie made the scheduling process easy. Then Chaz
              and crew showed up and made it all worth it. We LOVE our Black Walnut tree and have
              spent a couple seasons nursing it back to health from a beetle infestation with the
              help of an arborist. When Chaz and crew left all the dead was gone and the green looks
              great!&rdquo;

              &ldquo;Chaz and his team did an AMAZING job helping to clean up my giant cherry tree
              that we almost lost. I&apos;m so grateful, and they cleaned up beautifully and left
              everything pristine. I&apos;m so grateful that my cherry tree still looks so good,
              even after having to cut the entire top off.&rdquo;
