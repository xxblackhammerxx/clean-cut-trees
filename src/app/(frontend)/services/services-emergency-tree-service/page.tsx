                  <p key={118}>
                    <strong>Q: How quickly can you respond to emergencies in Davis County?</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p key={119}>
                    A: Our goal is 30-60 minutes for true life-safety emergencies, depending on
                    location within Davis County. Response time varies based on current weather
                    conditions, time of day, and current call volume. We maintain multiple crews
                    strategically positioned across Davis County to minimize response times during
                    storm events.
                  </p>
                  <p key={120}>
                    <strong>Q: Do you work during active storms and severe weather?</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p key={121}>
                    A: We continuously monitor weather conditions through the National Weather
                    Service and work whenever it's safe for our crews. During active severe weather
                    with lightning, extreme winds, or ice conditions, we may temporarily suspend
                    operations but resume immediately when conditions allow safe work to proceed.

                  <p key={122}>
                    <strong>
                      Q: What should I do while waiting for emergency service to arrive?
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p key={123}>
                    A: Keep all people and pets away from the damaged area, turn off electricity if
                    trees are near power lines, document damage with photographs if safe to do so,
                    and clear access routes for our crews and equipment. Never attempt to remove
                    trees or large branches yourself - this can result in serious injury or
                    additional property damage.

                    <strong>
                      Q: How much does emergency tree service cost compared to regular service?
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p key={125}>
                    A: Emergency rates reflect the after-hours response capability, specialized
                    equipment requirements, and immediate availability we maintain. Most homeowner's
                    insurance policies cover emergency tree removal when trees damage structures or
                    result from covered weather events. We provide detailed estimates and work
                    directly with your insurance company to streamline the claims process.

                      Q: Can emergency tree situations be prevented through regular maintenance?
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p key={127}>
                    A: Yes! Regular professional tree maintenance is the most effective prevention
                    strategy. Our certified arborists can identify potential hazards during routine
                    inspections and recommend preventive measures like strategic pruning, cabling,
                    bracing, or removal of high-risk trees before they become emergency situations.
