When you’re thinking about improving property value, it’s essential to consider the trees on your property.

Healthy trees can give your home or business a lot of aesthetic value, but some trees may be worth removing to [**improve your property value**](https://cleancutstrees.com/2025/03/06/does-clearing-land-increase-property-value) and keep it safe.

If you’re wondering, “Does cutting down trees increase property value?” read on to get the information you need from a professional **[tree service in Layton](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/layton-ut-tree-service/)**.

This guide has everything you need to know.

## **Does Cutting Down Trees Increase Property Value?**

There is no blanket “yes” or “no” answer to this question. In some instances, getting rid of trees (especially beautiful trees) on your property can harm your property value. However, in other cases, it may benefit it.

Let’s start with the basics: Does cutting down trees increase property value?

In some instances, yes! In fact, according to one study by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers (CTLA), removing certain trees can increase your home’s value by over $10,000.00!

Here are some of the most important factors when considering tree removal:

### **Unsuitable Location**

If a tree is growing too close to your house or garage, it could cause damage to those structures as it grows larger. An arborist can tell you how far away a tree needs to be from structures to stay safe and healthy during its life cycle.

### **Dead Trees**

If you see a dead tree on your property, you must remove it as soon as possible for both aesthetic and safety reasons. This is because in the event of a storm, they’re likely to fall over, causing injury or damage.

But how can you tell if a tree is dead? If you see signs of decay at the base of the trunk, your tree is likely dead or dying.

Also, because deciduous trees may look dead in winter (but are really dormant), you can perform the scratch test to be sure. In a living tree, the cambium layer of the bark is green instead of brown and dry, even in winter.

### **Overgrown Trees**

Overgrown trees can cause significant problems for your home, including a weakened foundation and damaged sewer lines. These issues are costly to fix and significantly decrease the value of your home.

## **Which Trees Are Valuable?**

A tree is always worth keeping if its trunk has a diameter greater than ten inches and if that diameter grows every year in increments of at least two inches. A tree with these characteristics is likely to add significant value to your property because it will provide excellent shade in the summer.
