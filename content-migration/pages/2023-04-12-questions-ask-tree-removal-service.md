Do you know what questions to ask a tree removal service before hiring them?

## Why Ask Questions? 

The right questions can help you determine the company’s ability and ensure you receive the help you need. Not all companies provide the same services or have equal amounts of experience.

Without researching the company, you may experience the following:

-   Poorly completed work
-   Illegal activity
-   Miscommunication on price and results
-   Liability for accidents may fall on you

For optimal results, research a potential company and hire one that answers your questions clearly and honestly.

## Questions to Ask

If you want to know what questions to ask a tree removal service, continue reading to see what the professionals say.

### Do You Have Proper Insurance?

A reliable company will provide proof of insurance at your request. Without insurance, you may become liable for any accidents or property damage. A professional will care for their staff and customers and ensure complete coverage.

The removal process remains dangerous to you, the workers, and your property, so continue searching if a company doesn’t provide proof of proper insurance.

### Is Your Team Certified?

One of the most important questions to ask a tree removal service is if they possess the necessary certifications. Most states require a certified arborist to perform tree removals because of the risks and responsibilities involved. It’s a detailed job requiring an in-depth understanding of tree biology and science.

Do not take a company’s word on this; request proof for verification.

### Will I Need a Permit?

Depending on your town, county, and neighborhood, you may require a permit before tree removal. The company will know the laws regarding your location and can help you understand your legal requirements.

Do not skip this question. Many locations take [**tree trimming laws**](https://cleancutstrees.com/2021/11/04/how-to-tell-when-its-time-to-remove-a-tree/) seriously, and you can get into serious legal trouble for working without permission.

### What’s Your Clean-Up Process?

Not all tree companies will remove the tree once felled, so ensure you ask about the clean-up. Depending on the tree, you may need heavy equipment and expertise to remove large trees safely. Find a company that helps with clean up so you can rest easy.

### Do You Provide Free Estimates?

The cost of tree removal varies widely, depending on several factors. Request a written estimate, and ensure every aspect of the removal gets put in writing. Always request a detailed estimate for stump grinding, waste removal, and fixing lawn damage.
