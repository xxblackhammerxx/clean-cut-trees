Trees add aesthetic appeal and value to any landscape. However, certain tree species can pose problems for your foundation, especially when planted too close to your building.   

So, which tree roots damage foundations? Here’s more from a top-rated [**tree cutting service in Layton, UT**.](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/layton-ut-tree-service/)

## Poplars Have Roots That Grow Quickly

Gardeners and landscapers favor poplars for their beautiful shape and foliage. These trees thrive well in clay soils and require minimal pruning and maintenance, which is great for property owners looking for easier yards. Unfortunately, poplars also feature fast-growing roots that move laterally across the soil.

Species of poplar that may damage your foundation when planted close to your building include the following:

-   White poplars
-   Carolina poplars
-   Lombardy poplars
-   Cottonwood

Plant poplars 30-50 feet away from any structures to prevent foundation issues.  

## The Roots of Silver Maples, Ash, and American Elms Are All Problematic

Silver maples have shallow roots that expose themselves above ground. Since these roots take up space, they make it difficult for other plants to thrive under or around the maple tree. Keep silver maples away from your foundation, sidewalks, and driveways.  

Thanks to their extensive, domed canopies, ash trees provide refreshing shade during hot summers. Unfortunately, they have a thirsty, invasive [**root system**](https://extension.umd.edu/resource/damaged-tree-roots) upwards of 30 feet that sprawls across the yard and may cause shifts in your building’s foundation.

Elms have moisture-loving roots that tend to invade drain pipes and sewer lines. If the roots of an American elm make their way under your foundation, they’ll also absorb too much moisture and create voids that lead to settlement issues. The weight of your structure could then force the foundation to sink and fill these spaces.

## Oaks and Other Trees Can Ruin Your Property’s Foundations

So, which [**tree roots**](https://cleancutstrees.com/2024/08/12/how-to-remove-big-tree-roots-from-the-ground/) damage foundations? The last type of tree to mention is the oak, which has shallow roots and absorbs large quantities of water and nutrients from the soil. Investing in root barriers may help redirect opportunistic root systems away from foundations and plumbing lines, preventing costly damage down the line. 

Other trees that you should avoid planting near your home include the following:  

-   Black locusts  
-   Honey locusts  
-   Crimean pine  
-   Norway spruce  
-   Boxelder  
-   Sycamore  
-   Sweetgum  

To counteract the potential foundation issues, experts often suggest planting regular trees at least ten feet away from structures. Trees with aggressive root systems must be at least 25 to 50 feet away, so seek professional advice before planting anything. If you notice or suspect root issues, be sure to call a certified arborist for help.
