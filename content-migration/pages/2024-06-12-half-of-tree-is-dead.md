You want your trees to not only look healthy but to _be_ healthy. Like all living things, trees are susceptible to disease and damage from the elements. So, what do you do when half of your tree is dead? In this article, we’ll discuss the signs that a tree is dying and how [Farmington’s top tree service](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/farmington-ut-tree-service/) can help.

## What Are the Signs of a Half-Dead Tree

You may not know that half of the tree is dead until it’s too late. You might think it’s dehydrated or affected by the elements. However, there are noteworthy signs to pay attention to. If half of your tree is dead, it might: 

-   Have several dead limbs 
-   Lean to one side 
-   Look barren on one side

Healthy trees will stand upright. They’ll also have lush leaves covering both sides and sturdy tree trunks. If your tree doesn’t fit that description, then you’ll know it’s dying. 

## Common Causes for Half-Dead Trees 

There are many reasons that could explain why half of a tree is dead. Let’s consider the most common: 

-   **Fungi**: Fungi are like kryptonite to your tree, especially the roots. Phytophthora root rot can affect tree trunks, giving once-dense structures a sunken look. 
-   **Pest infestations**: When pests decide to occupy a tree, they take no prisoners. Beetles are the main culprits, as they destroy the bark and branches.
-   **The elements**: Believe it or not, Mother Nature can rear her ugly head and destroy half of your tree. Lightning, for example, can strike one side of your [tall](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6763443/) [t](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6763443/)[ree](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6763443/) and leave lasting destruction.
-   **Soil issues**: Compressed soil can’t supply your tree with essential nutrients. Without these nutrients, it will die. Sometimes, this is due to erosion or construction occurring on one side.
-   **Root problems**: Have you ever seen a tree with expansive, exposed roots? While interesting to look at, it isn’t good for the tree. This phenomenon is a telltale sign of tree disease. 

## Can You Save a Half-Dead Tree

When caught early, saving a half-dead tree isn’t impossible. A trained arborist will have to:

-   Assess the damage
-   Determine if the dead tree can be saved
-   Provide the proper treatment options 

## What Happens If the Tree Is Too Damaged?

Only a licensed and trained arborist can determine next steps, so it’s wise to seek their advice. 

Removing a half-dead tree also protects your curb appeal. It’s no secret that dead and diseased trees are hard on the eyes. Removing it improves the look of your property.
