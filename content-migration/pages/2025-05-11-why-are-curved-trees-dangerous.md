A curved tree might have a unique visual appeal that you enjoy having within your overall landscape. However, plants with trunks that don’t grow straight are more hazardous than you think. So why are curved trees dangerous? 

Local [tree services in Riverdale, UT](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/riverdale-ut-tree-service/), from Clean Cuts Trees could resolve this problem if it happens to you. But first, learn about the dangers of leaning or curved trees below. 

## What Causes Trees To Develop Curves?

[Trees](https://smithfieldutah.gov/sites/default/files/fileattachments/tree_committee/page/9286/native_trees.pdf) can grow healthily with natural curves. Although this type of growth isn’t much of a concern in forested areas, it can be problematic in suburban or urban settings. The curve could indicate a structural problem that jeopardizes nearby structures and passersby. 

So what causes the curve? Poor soil condition is a typical cause. Erosion, compaction, and excessive water saturation can weaken tree roots, causing the plant to lean instead of growing upright. 

Root damage from construction and landscape projects is another problem. Plants will have difficulty remaining upright without stable root systems. 

Finally, adverse weather conditions can alter the growth patterns of young, vulnerable trees. Even if major storms with heavy wind and rain don’t topple a tree entirely or cause stress fractures, they could change the plant’s overall structure and stability. 

## Reasons Curved Trees Are Sometimes Hazardous

Why are curved trees dangerous? The wind risk for leaning plants is much higher than those without defective growth because of an irregular shape. The risk of significant damage is high if the plant leans over powerlines, your roof, or another structure. 

Limb failure and a fall are also more likely with leaning plants if they lack nutrients and sunlight. Without sufficient nutrition, the plants may struggle to grow counterbalance roots to prevent a fall under high winds. Diseases and infestations can weaken tree trunks and promote stress fractures in heavy branches.

## How To Recognize a Dangerous Curved Tree

Want to know whether your curved tree is hazardous? Watch for these warning signs:

-   **Major lean:** Pay close attention to plants in your yard. If the trunk develops a sudden lean or the angle of its existing lean changes, the plant is potentially hazardous. 
-   **Poor tree health:** Do you spot signs of disease, pest infestations, or decay in your plant? If so, decreased structural instability puts it at high risk of a fall. 
-   **Nearness to structures:** The last thing you want to deal with is a tree that falls onto your home, sidewalk, utility line, or public space. Get help immediately for a curved tree near structures.
