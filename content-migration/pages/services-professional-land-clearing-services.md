### What Happens to the Discarded Material?

Clean Cuts Trees takes pride in not only being a land clearing specialist but also being an environmentalist. We are careful to protect our Earth and the neighborhoods in and around Layton and Kaysville, UT. If there are articles of trash or recyclable materials strewn throughout your land, we will make efforts to dispose of them in an eco-friendly manner. As for the brush material, trees, and stumps, we will repurpose that into mulch. We will even leave a layer of mulched material on top of your cleared area to protect the minimally-disturbed soil below.

### The Benefits of Mulch Produced by Land Clearing Services

Mulch has a multitude of benefits, adding to the overall positive impact of land clearing provided by Clean Cuts Trees. Firstly, when placed atop the cleared area, it will serve as an erosion barrier. This element will allow you to use the land right away, as the mulch will enrich the soil and permit wanted vegetation to begin growing immediately. Additional benefits of mulch include protection from temperature changes during the cold Layton and Kaysville, UT winters, moisture conservation, and enhanced visual appeal.

### We Also Perform Selective Clearing

Selective clearing is a process in which a property owner chooses specific trees that he or she would like to leave alone during land clearing efforts. Clean Cuts Trees can accommodate this desire by utilizing careful precision to only remove unwanted trees and vegetation.
