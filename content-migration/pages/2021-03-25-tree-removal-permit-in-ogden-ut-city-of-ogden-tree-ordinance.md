Forests cover a significant percentage of the landscape in Ogden, UT. Unfortunately, among them are some endangered, threatened, and invasive species. Whether you need a permit to remove a tree in Ogden depends primarily on the tree’s location.

In many cases, you don’t need a permit to remove a tree if you own the property on which it sits. Except for Salt Lake City, Utah state law protects what it calls “Heritage Trees.” That means you cannot cut down any tree designated by the state as indigenous or well adapted to the climate.

You will need a tree removal permit, however, to remove any tree on [Ogden city land](https://www.ogdencity.com/Faq.aspx?QID=106). The City of Ogden tree ordinance regulates the removal of trees in Ogden. Other ranger districts have their own rules and regulations.

For instance, residents of Ogden, UT, who want to cut down their own Christmas trees in natural forests or state parks will need Christmas tree permits.

## How It Works

You can remove park and city trees only with authority from Urban Forestry Services and when you have a removal permit. The authorization may be for reasons such as:

-   The tree is causing damage to infrastructures such as water and sewer lines, and the issue cannot be fixed using other tree maintenance methods.
-   Maintaining the tree is no longer feasible. The maintenance costs exceed the environmental benefits derived from the tree.
-   The tree is deteriorating, dying, or dead and is a hazard to property and/or people.
-   The tree has such a poor aesthetic value that removing it will visually enhance the site.
-   The tree severely interferes with the growth and development of a more desirable public tree.
-   The tree is a severe hazard that’s beyond the point of correction.
-   Public work requirements dictate that work done around the tree will either render it a hazard or kill it.
-   The tree is infected with a disease, invasive insect species, or pathogen.

According to Ogden’s arboricultural regulations, you can only remove trees per accepted industry standards and procedures and by following the minimum requirements, which include:

-   Branches and limbs larger than four inches in diameter should be lowered using ropes or other mechanical devices if the tree service or arborist removing the tree cannot control the fall.
-   You shouldn’t leave stumps higher than six inches above the ground.
-   During tree removal, take extreme care to prevent damage to structures and other property.

## How to File for a Tree Removal Permit in Ogden, UT

Filing for a permit to remove any park or street tree in Ogden requires you to make an application in writing to the Public Ways and Parks Division. The application should include your name and address, the name and address of the person removing the tree, the species or kind of tree or shrub, and its respective location. During the application, you must agree in writing to protect the city and public and save the city from harm in all respects at all times in connection with the work performed under the permit.

## Expiration of Tree Removal Permit in Ogden, UT

Any permit issued for the removal of trees shall mention the name of the person performing the work, the location of the work, and any requirements and conditions in connection with the work. Also:

-   All permit work should comply with the city’s arboricultural regulations.
-   Anyone who exceeds the authorization given in the permit is subject to penalties.
-   Unless otherwise stated, a tree removal permit shall expire 30 days after issuance.

As a condition of the removal permit and when the tree in question is healthy and authorized to be removed at your request, the Public Ways and Parks Division may require you to compensate the city for the value of the tree’s removal either by monetary assessment or replacement thereof with the species, size, and location approved by Urban Forestry Services.
