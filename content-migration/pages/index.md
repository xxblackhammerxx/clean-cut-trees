If You Have Trees, Then You Need Clean Cuts!

    ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ This is the third time we've used Clean Cuts Trees, and once again, they delivered excellent service. Their response time was impressively fast, and they did a fantastic job at a very fair price. The work site was left spotless, which we really appreciated. Chaz, the job supervisor, was a pleasure to work with — professional, communicative, and made sure everything ran smoothly. Every experience we've had with them has been consistently great. Highly recommend!

    First - the people. Zac and Laurie made the scheduling process easy. Then Chaz and crew showed up and made it all worth it. Second - We LOVE our Black Walnut tree and have spent a couple seasons nursing it back to health from a beetle infestation with the help of an arborist. When Chaz and crew left all the dead was gone and the green looks great! The tree still has some healing, filling in and growing to do - but it’s shape looked great and our yard was respectfully treated and cleared. Glad we found them.

    Chaz and his team did and AMAZING job helping to clean up my giant cherry tree that we almost lost. I'm so grateful, and they cleaned up beautifully and left everything pristine. I'm so grateful that my cherry tree still looks so good, even after having to cut the entire top off.

### FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

We are here to answer all your tree related questions!

##### Why Is It Important To Trim My Trees?

Your trees are important and should be cared for. If you let them grow too thick, they could fall during storms! Trimming your trees is a great way to keep them healthy and strong. If their branches get too thick, they cause other problems for homeowners.

##### How Often Should Trees Be Trimmed?

This will depend on how quickly they grow new branches and therefore need more frequent trimming sessions to keep up their health. The issue with a fast-growing tree is that it could cause problems for the homeowners, so you have to get an expert to inspect your yard, and he can provide you with an effective plan.

##### Should I Cut Down A Tree Close To The House?

A dead or dying tree can be a threat to your home, so it’s best if you remove the hazard. A hazardous situation like this poses serious risks for possible damage that could cause major issues, like costly repairs down the line!

##### What Is Storm Cleanup?

It is a necessity for those who have undergone the consequence of a hurricane, tornado, or other weather-related damages to their trees and yards. When you require help with your yard, let us take care. Our team can clean up any mess left by storms and provide a beautiful place for all to see!
