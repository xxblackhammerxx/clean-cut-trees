Tree moths in Utah cause extensive damage each year. While beautiful, the moth is an invasive pest that can decimate trees. In this post, Clean Cuts Trees, your reliable, [**professional tree removal in Kaysville, UT**](https://cleancutstrees.com/services/tree-removal/), discusses the different types of moth infestations and other environmental factors that affect your trees. 

## Why Are Codling Moth Populations Such a Major Pest?

Moths are primarily nocturnal, meaning they are more active at night. Therefore, much of their movements go unnoticed. They are destructive for trees because of the life stages they move through:

-   Adults may bore into trees to lay their eggs or lay them on the underside of leaves.
-   When the eggs hatch, the larvae will feed on the tree. 
-   The adult caterpillar will munch on tree leaves.
-   When the caterpillar is in the chrysalis is the least harmful stage (the pupa).
-   When the moth emerges, it continues to eat the leaves and damages the tree by laying eggs.

While there are over 160,000 species, the following are the most harmful moths in Utah for trees.

## 1\. Gypsy Moth

Gypsy Moths are efficient defoliators, damaging over a million acres of forest annually. The moths lay their eggs at the beginning of spring, just as the tree’s new leaves start to bud. By the time the larvae hatch, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of hungry mouths to feed. 

These moths particularly enjoy the following trees but will move to others if necessary:

-   Oak
-   Maple
-   Elm
-   Birch

Look out for egg masses that look like a teardrop—you will find these on tree trunks. Dispose of them immediately because each bunch can contain as many as 500 eggs. The larvae cause extensive damage and may defoliate the entire tree.

## 2\. Western Tent Caterpillar

The Western Tent Caterpillar is an equal-opportunity offender but prefers: 

-   Fruit trees
-   Cottonwoods
-   Willows
-   Poplars
-   Aspens

They are quite easy to spot in the middle of spring thanks to the light silk tents they weave. The larvae live inside the structure, expanding it as necessary. You will notice shriveled leaves, foliage discoloration, or leaf drop starting at the top of the tree.

## 3\. Douglas Fir Tussock Moths

As you might infer from the name, these moths have a penchant for Douglas Firs. However, they will attack other firs, like the Blue Spruce, if necessary. The danger with these infestations is that the moths shelter in one tree and will remain there year after year. 

The larvae eat the new needles in late spring, causing foliage discoloration at the branches’ outer edges and the tree’s crown. The adults tend to lay the egg bundles underneath the lower branches. 

We recommend removing them with care, as contact with the larvae can irritate the skin.
