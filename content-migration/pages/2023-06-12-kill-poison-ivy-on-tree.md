## Why Remove Poison Ivy from Trees?

[**Poison ivy**](https://www.aces.edu/blog/topics/forestry/touch-me-nots-poison-ivy-poison-oak-and-poison-sumac/) negatively affects trees in numerous ways. It can stunt growth, make trees more prone to breakage, damage the bark, and more if you don’t address the ivy swiftly. Below are just a few reasons you must remove poison ivy vines from trees.

## How to Get Rid of Poison Ivy on Trees

Learning how to kill poison Ivy on a tree isn’t difficult once you understand the correct methods.

You can remove poison ivy in two ways:

-   Physically remove the vines
-   Apply a herbicide treatment

### Physical Removal

If you plan on removing poison ivy manually, always wear protective gear to protect yourself from urushiol oil (the oil that causes rashes). Wear long, thick clothing and durable gloves before cutting the vine and removing it from the trunk or branches. Carefully remove parts of the plant without damaging the tree’s bark or branches.

### Herbicide Treatment

Using herbicide treatments to eliminate poison ivy is a bit more effective but requires a few extra steps.

Start by cutting small nicks into the trunk to expose the phloem and xylem within the tree. Then spread the herbicide over the wounds and allow the tree to soak up the solution. Over time, the solution will slowly kill the ivy and help the tree recover.

You can also cut the vine’s base and apply the herbicide to the fissure to preserve the tree’s trunk and eliminate the ivy quicker. Just follow the herbicide’s instruction label to ensure optimal results.
