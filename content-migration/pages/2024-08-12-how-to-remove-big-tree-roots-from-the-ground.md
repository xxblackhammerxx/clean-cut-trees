Beautiful trees provide excellent shade, but their giant root systems can cause a lot of problems in suburban and urban areas. Their roots can break up sidewalks, building foundations, and roads, causing financial headaches for whoever is responsible for repairs. Knowing how to remove big tree roots from the ground is a good skill to have when it comes time to get rid of annoying trees.

## Removing Big Tree Roots

The best way of determining how to remove big tree roots from the ground will depend on time and horsepower. If you have the tools, time, and strength, you can do it manually. If you don’t have that, chemicals might be better. Of course, you can always call the professionals at Clean Cuts Trees.

### The Manual Way

The manual way might take you all day (or week, depending on the size) and requires several steps:

-   **Water:** Water the ground around the tree deeply the day before. This will loosen the soil and make it easier to dig.
-   **Dig:** Grab a trusty shovel and start digging around the tree to expose as many roots as possible. The more time you dedicate to excavation, the easier root cutting will be.
-   **Cut:** Cut the outer roots with a saw and head inwards as you reveal more roots. Use a stump grinder to whittle down the stump as you go, or you can save it for the end after you remove all the roots.
-   **Repeat:** Continue watering, digging, cutting, and grinding as needed. Remember that tree roots are long and have several offshoots.
-   **Repair:** After you finish removing the stump, backfill the area with soil. You’ll likely need to add soil every few months as it compacts and sinks down.

### The Chemical Way

You can use herbicides to remove tree roots. The process is much slower and will still require some digging, but it won’t take as much effort.

After removing the tree, water the stump well. Then, pour the herbicide all over the tree. After two weeks, the roots should be dead and ready to dig out. Repeat this process as needed if you notice persistent [tree growth](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022AV000859).

Herbicides may pose a risk to nearby plants, animals, and people, so be sure to follow the directions on the label so you can use them safely and effectively.

## Why You Should Rely on the Professionals

It’s good to know how to remove big tree roots from the ground, but it’s better to let professional arborists handle the tough jobs. Saws and herbicides are dangerous to work with. When you hire the professionals at Clean Cuts Trees, you don’t have to worry about accidentally injuring yourself while on the job.
