Trees offer [many benefits](https://www.treesaregood.org/treeowner/benefitsoftrees), including cleaner air, shade, and beauty.

Here’s a guide to municipal tree service.

They can also do tree pruning to make sure limbs and branches are less of a threat. Dead trees and limbs are a safety hazard, and knowing when and how to remove them is key. 

Stumps are often seen as eyesores in between sidewalks and right-of-ways. Removing the entire root system is tricky. A municipal tree service can remove them to beautify the area.
