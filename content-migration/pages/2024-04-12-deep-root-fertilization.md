Everyone knows fertilizing tree roots is a great way to ensure your tree is healthy. If you have a plant in urban soil, the odds are that your soil isn’t rich enough to provide all the nutrients your tree needs. This is where deep root feeding can make a splendid difference to your tree’s lifespan.

If you want to know more about deep root fertilization, let Clean Cuts Trees, [Layton’s tree service contractor](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/layton-ut-tree-service/), explain everything you need about the benefits of root zone nutrient application.

## What Is Soil Injection Fertilization?

Soil injection fertilization, or deep root fertilization, is a fertilization process that helps the tree by injecting the surrounding soil with fertilizer to help it grow. High-pressure injections dig down into the soil to reach the roots deep underground. This helps the tree get the nutrients it needs by placing them right next to where it can gather them.

This below-ground fertilization is a great way to bolster a tree’s growth, ensuring it receives the nutrients it needs to remain healthy and fight off disease.

## What Are The Benefits of Subsurface Tree Fertilization?

If you’re considering deep-root fertilization for the trees in your yard, there are plenty of reasons to undertake the effort.

### It Promotes Growth

When you give your tree the nutrients it craves, it can thrive. The leaves will be thicker and more vibrant, and you may yield a more robust canopy and bloom ratio than last summer. Aerating the soil around your tree also helps the soil improve so that your tree can stay healthy even after your fertilizer boost is long gone.

### It Prevents Disease

Giving your tree deep root fertilization is like giving it some vitamins. With a boost to the tree’s resources, you’ll find that your tree is more weather-resistant during harsh storms or heavy frosts.

Trees with the right nutrients in their roots can even be more resistant to diseases or pests that attempt to invade their bark and dig into their trunks. While deep root fertilization can’t entirely prevent tree-borne illnesses, it can at least give your tree a good chance of resisting illness.

### It Promotes Aesthetics

When you have a healthy tree, it will look bigger and [more beautiful during the summertime](https://journalistsresource.org/home/tree-health-equity/). Supplying your tree with the nutrients it needs can help it look more aesthetically pleasing in your yard, with not only fuller leaves and more extensive branches but also roots that will hold the tree through storms. If you provide your tree with deep root fertilization, it can look better and last longer than other trees.
