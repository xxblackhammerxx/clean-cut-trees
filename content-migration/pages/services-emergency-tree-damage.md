# Emergency Tree Damage

# **Emergency Tree Damage in Utah**

What is emergency tree damage? Primarily, the emergency damage is when a tree falls on your home, car, or anything else that makes it necessary to have it cleaned up and removed quickly. If a tree falls on the corner of your home, your family is suddenly without shelter. You want to rebuild, but the first step is removing the tree so that you can get a contractor crew out to start repairing the damage.

### **How to Prevent the Need for an Emergency**

It gives you peace of mind to know that Clean Cuts Trees in Kaysville, UT, Layton, UT, Weber County, UT, and Davis County, UT, is there for you in the event of an emergency. Ideally, you would hope to never need that kind of care. Some sources of damage (lightning strikes, for example) are unavoidable, but others may be prevented. Here are some strategies to ensure that the risk of trees causing damage on your property is as low as possible.

-   **Have your trees serviced regularly**: Every few years, it’s a good idea to have professionals check your trees for possible health and stability concerns as well as clear off deadwood.
-   **Make sure to have dead trees removed**: Dead trees don’t only cause problems themselves, but can also fall and knock off sizable limbs of healthy trees, a ripple effect that heightens the risk of damage and the need for emergency tree care.
