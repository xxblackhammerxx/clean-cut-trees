# Tree Trimming

# **Professional Tree Trimming**

At [Clean Cuts Trees](https://cleancutstrees.com/) serving Kaysville, UT, Layton, UT, Weber County, UT, and Davis County, UT, we handle two primary service areas: tree trimming and tree removal. Tree removal, while delicate and dangerous if not done correctly, is not a complicated process. We simply cut down the tree, direct it to fall in a safe location, and haul it away for you. Tree trimming, on the other hand, is more of an art form. Knowing when and where to cut while pruning can make the difference between a healthy, attractive tree and an undesirable, potentially dying tree. That’s why we recommend that you ensure that the team handling your pruning and trimming are the experts at Clean Cuts Trees. Remember, not all tree removal companies are also able to prune your trees correctly, and not all tree trimming experts can handle removals in the safest way possible. Fortunately for you, we can do both!
