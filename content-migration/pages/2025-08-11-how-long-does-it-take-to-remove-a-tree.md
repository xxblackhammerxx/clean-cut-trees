If it’s time to remove a tree from your yard, you might wonder about the professional tree removal process. How long does it take to remove a tree when you rely on professional [tree services in Hooper, UT](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/hooper-ut-tree-service/)? Some jobs only require a couple of hours, while others need several hours.

Learn more about the circumstances that affect the tree removal timeline.

## What Factors Cause Tree Removal To Take Longer?

A smaller, primarily healthy tree will take a couple of hours to remove. The risk of branches popping loose unexpectedly is lower with a healthy plant.

Trees that are 50 feet or taller take longer to remove. They require more equipment and may need to be removed in sections. 

A tree that’s near your house or is in a hard-to-reach location on the property may take longer to remove. The arborist requires extra time to plan the work and must use extra caution in cases like this.

## How Long Does Each Step in Tree Removal Require?

How long does it take to remove a tree, and are there steps beyond cutting it down? Although the most time-consuming part of [tree removal](https://todayshomeowner.com/lawn-garden/guides/tree-removal/) stems from cutting it down, you’ll need to allow time for some of the other steps.

### Assessing and Planning the Job

Arborists will study the tree that needs removal to look for potential complications. If the tree is not near structures and is healthy, the planning process might only take a few minutes. It can take an hour or more when complexities exist.

### Clearing the Site

If you have movable items near the tree, it’ll take several minutes to place those items in a safe location. You might need to move cars, bicycles, and dog houses. Keep people at a safe distance throughout the process.

### Removing the Tree

Tree removal may take one to five hours. Arborists might need to take out large limbs in the upper sections of the tree before they can cut the main trunk.

Some trees require removal in sections to make the job safer. If the crew has room to fell the tree in one cut, this will shorten the timeline required. 

### Cleaning Up the Site

Picking up the fallen branches, clearing the larger chunks of the tree, and grinding the stump can take another 30 minutes to two hours. Mulching the tree branches on site can reduce the amount of time required compared to hauling them away.
