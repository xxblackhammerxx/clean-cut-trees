Few things say “majestic beauty” better than a tree with a large canopy. However, how big should the canopy be? Should tree branches hang over your roof?

The truth is, overhanging branches often turn a beautiful tree into a significant safety hazard. Thankfully, there’s a quick and effective way to remedy this and guarantee personal and property safety. Read on to learn what to do with the tree branches hanging over your roof.

## The Dangers of Overhanging Branches

When left unchecked, your tree’s branches can grow in any direction. Sometimes, if the tree is close to your home, its branches can end up hanging over your roof. While this might initially seem harmless, maybe even attractive, it poses several dangers.

### Gutter Clogging

Besides roof damage, overhanging branches can leave you with clogged gutters. Leaves and twigs find their way into your gutter system, impacting its ability to direct water away from your home.

### Pest Infestations

Overgrown branches are a haven for certain pests and rodents. Sometimes, these pests can spread to your home, causing costly damage.

The overgrown branches on your roof often create the perfect environment for mold. If left unattended, the mold can spread, compromising your home’s structure and creating significant health risks.
