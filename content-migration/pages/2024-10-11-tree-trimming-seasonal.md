![How To Tell If Your Trees Need Trimming This Season](https://cleancutstrees.com/wp-content/uploads/tree-trimming-1080x600.jpg)

Ogden and the surrounding region enjoy four distinct seasons each year. That seasonal climate means it is crucial to carefully consider when to trim or prune trees.  

As a [highly rated tree service specialist in Ogden, Utah](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/north-ogden-ut-tree-service/), Clean Cuts Trees presents some of the top indications that your tree will need professional trimming this season. 

## Tree Trimming and Seasonal Considerations in Ogden 

For most species, [tree trimming and pruning](https://cleancutstrees.com/2025/04/11/tree-trimming-vs-tree-pruning/) should only take place during the correct season. In our area, late winter to early spring is the best time to trim most tree species. Careful, clean cuts should come during the dormant season to minimize stress and the risk of disease or pest infection.

Look for these signs any time of the year as indicators that tree trimming during the next dormant period is necessary. 

### Overgrown Canopy

A tree’s canopy is its uppermost branches and leaf structure. It could be time for canopy thinning if you notice densely packed and interwoven branches. This practice allows better sunlight penetration and airflow to lower branches and leaves, promoting overall health and growth.

### Low-Hanging Branches

Arborists describe the trimming technique that addresses branches hanging too low over walkways, driveways, buildings, or [landscaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscaping#:~:text=Landscaping%20refers%20to%20any%20activity,a%20beauty%20within%20the%20landscape.) as crown lifting. A tree expert will select the proper lower branches to prune to elevate the height of the canopy. Especially with trees still approaching maturity, it’s imperative to properly select branches for removal.  

### Dead or Diseased Wood

Sometimes, the season takes a backseat to safety when it comes to promptly pruning dead or severely weakened branches. Deadwood clearing helps eliminate safety risks and promotes recovery and healthy growth.  

### Excessive Weight on Branches

Branches that appear to carry excessive weight loads present increased safety hazards, especially during high winds or storms.

Selected branch removal can reduce the overall load on the tree not only during summer and fall but also during winter when ice and snow can immediately stress the already weakened structure. 

### Structural Issues

If you notice obvious structural defects, like crossing branches or obviously weak limb attachments, these are clear indications you should consult a tree expert about pruning. Proper removal of damaged or infirm branches reduces the risk of wounds and disease that can endanger the entire tree.  

### Excessive Shade

While we enjoy and want to promote beneficial shading, there is a balance to strike. An overly dense canopy will impair the growth of the lower parts of a tree and surrounding plants.
