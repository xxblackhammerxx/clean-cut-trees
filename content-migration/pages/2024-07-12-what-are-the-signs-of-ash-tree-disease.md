Ash trees add beauty and shade to the Eden, UT, landscape, but they are also susceptible to a variety of diseases that lead to premature tree death. However, it’s possible to prevent many of the most common tree problems, and that begins with learning how to identify signs of disease. 

Our [tree service in Eden](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/eden-ut-tree-service/) wants to help you stay ahead of issues with your precious ash trees. This guide answers, “What are the signs of ash tree disease?” highlights the most common conditions, and explains how to avoid them.

## The Most Common Ash Tree Diseases 

Ash trees are vulnerable to a wide [variety of diseases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089649/) due to fungi, insects, and viruses. 

### Emerald Ash Borer (EAB)

Invasive Emerald ash borers kill ash trees by disrupting the flow of water and nutrients. The insect larvae feed under the bark, and when they reach adulthood, they emerge via D-shaped exit holes. Eventually, the tree becomes brittle and weak and dies. 

In addition to the exit holes, emerald ash borer infestation causes the tree’s canopy to yellow and become sparse, and creates vertical splits in the bark. The only solution is to remove infected trees to keep the insects from moving on and causing further EAB tree death. 

### Verticillium Wilt 

Verticillium wilt is a fungal disease that comes from infected soil. The fungus stops the transport of water and nutrients throughout the tree, causing rapid tree death. Signs include yellowing and wilting leaves, usually on one side of the tree or a single branch, as well as brown streaks in the sapwood and rapidly dying limbs. 

Some species of ash trees are resistant to verticillium wilt. Proper irrigation and fertilization, and using fungicides at the first sign of illness, can prevent this disease. 

### Anthracnose 

While yellowing leaves and dying branches are the most frequent answer to “What are the signs of ash tree disease?” a tree infected with anthracnose fungus has different symptoms. This infection causes the leaves to develop black, tan, or brown spots and can also cause leaf loss and stunted growth. Proper pruning, fertilization, and watering, as well as fungicide application, can prevent anthracnose. 

### Ash Yellows

If your ash tree develops this disease, it needs prompt removal to prevent the spreading of the infection. A bacterial parasite causes ash yellows which leads to leaf discoloration, premature leaf drop, and dying branches.

### Ash Rust 

Ash rust is a fungal infection that causes the leaves to grow abnormally, curl, or fall off. The most common signs are raised rust-colored structures on the leaf and yellow-orange pustules on the underside of the leaves. Good tree care can prevent the illness, and you can save the tree by removing and destroying any affected leaves or branches.
