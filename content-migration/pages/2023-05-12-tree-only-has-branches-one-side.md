![Tree Only Has Branches on One Side – What Does It Mean](./assets/1b6fd725ef17d4cf754e77718e98e8874849a819.jpg)

Most trees have branches on both sides of their stem. However, some only have limbs on one side, leaving many people curious about the peculiar formation. So, why do some trees only have branches on one side?

To get to the bottom of this strange phenomena, Clean Cuts Trees put together a few reasons why a tree only has branches on one side.

## Why Does a Tree Only Have Branches on One Side?

Again, most healthy trees grow branches on both sides of their stem, creating a beautiful canopy that gives trees their distinct look. However, some only grow limbs on one side, leaving many Kaysville residents with more questions than answers. The strange branch growth stems from various factors, ranging from element interference to location.

Below are some common reasons a tree only has branches on one side.

### Severe Winds

Strong, consistent winds can bend branches to one side of a tree over time, dramatically altering the entire tree’s branch growth. Trees in highly windy areas become “wind trained” and grow limbs in the direction of the wind. The altered growth pattern becomes permanent, with the heavy winds [**killing branches**](https://extension.umd.edu/resource/what-causes-trees-and-shrubs-die) on the rival side.

Tree specialists call these trees flag trees since they look like fully extended flags on windy days. 

### Winter Desiccation

Winter desiccation refers to trees drying out during winter. In some areas, the extreme dryness kills foliage on the upwind side of a tree, preventing healthy growth. However, the other side doesn’t experience excessive dryness and continues growing limbs, creating a flag tree later in the season.

### Hormones

Some experts believe trees in specific areas release hormones that prevent branch growth on the upwind side of their structure. They think continual pressure forces the tree to release auxins, giving it a flag-like shape that eventually becomes permanent. 

It’s important to note that scientists don’t know the exact cause of a tree growing branches on one side and not the other. Although they have some information to support their estimations, it isn’t clear cut and requires much more research. Hopefully, more information comes out soon and will help arborists pinpoint the root cause of the peculiar occurrence.
