Learning how to cut down a tree near a house requires significant care. Locally, many people choose to do this job safely with the help of our professional [tree services in Hooper, UT](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/hooper-ut-tree-service/). Below, you can see why tree removal safety is important, especially for your home and whoever is doing the cutting.

## Why Cutting a Tree Near a House Is Dangerous

Do you need to remove a tree that is [close to your house](https://cleancutstrees.com/2025/01/12/how-to-cut-down-a-tree-near-a-house/) or another building on your property? Don’t underestimate the task; this type of work requires extra care at all times.

When cutting down a tree in an open area, fall direction planning feels less daunting. However, near a building, experts will use specific techniques during their chainsaw operation to ensure the tree comes down in a safe location and well away from your home.

If a large tree fell on your home, simply the weight of the trunk and limbs could damage your roof, gutters, windows, and walls. If it goes directly into an upstairs bedroom window or ceiling, your family’s safety and possessions are instantly in jeopardy. Using a chainsaw near a home also risks small children or pets becoming curious about what you’re doing and approaching the unaware cutter, putting them in danger of lacerations and worse.

## Techniques To Cut Down a Tree Near a House

When removing a tree in an area where you have space restrictions, the best technique usually involves removing it in sections. You’ll need ropes and ladders to be able to force the sections to fall in a certain direction. Plus, depending on the location of the tree, using a crane or a cherry picker might be necessary. 

On most tree-removal jobs, workers will apply slings and cables to the sections of the trunk or branches, lifting these pieces out of the way as each cut occurs. Once the remaining tree is small enough, it’s easier to control the trunk. Such techniques are incredibly difficult and dangerous for the average homeowner to handle, so hiring licensed arborists is much safer.

## Is It Better To Try To Save a Tree Near a House?

Rather than undertaking the risk of taking down a tree near a home, you might want to call professional arborists to try to save it first. These tree experts deploy multiple techniques, and if the tree has significant damage or cracked branches and trunks, they’ll confirm that [cutting the tree down](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd925558.pdf) is the only viable option. 

A dying tree that falls unexpectedly could damage your home and injure bystanders. Taking it down in a controlled manner is safer when it’s near your home.
