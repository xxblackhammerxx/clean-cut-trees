Girdling tree roots can be a real problem for tree development, whether en masse or just for one tree in your back yard. Before you can learn how to fix girdling tree roots, you’ll need to understand how to spot and prevent them, especially if you’re actively planting trees.

Correcting girdling tree roots is a process that needs to happen before the tree is in the ground. However, if you notice that your tree needs girdling roots repair to prevent damage or a shortened lifespan, you can save your tree with expert care. Fixing girdled tree root systems with preventative measures from [**Layton’s trusted tree service**](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/layton-ut-tree-service/) is easy.

## How Girdling Roots Occur

If your tree has problems with girdling roots, the symptoms may be on the surface, while the real problem is just below the dirt. Addressing girdled tree roots starts with understanding how girdling roots occur in nature. While [**commonplace tree health preventative measures**](https://pressbooks.lib.vt.edu/treesteward/chapter/9/) can prolong a tree’s life, most girdling tree root issues begin while the tree is young, impacting it only once it has grown. Your trees can get girdling roots by:

-   Being planted in too small of a hole.
-   Being left in a restrictive planting box for too long.
-   Being transplanted incorrectly, such as in a restrictive urban environment or without sufficient room to grow.
-   Being planted adjacent to debris, leaf litter, or pieces of a planting container where these objects can obstruct or divert root growth.

If you know your tree has experienced any of these, then you’re set to learn how to fix girdling tree roots. However, girdling roots are often a subtle killer of trees, manifesting in many ways that show the tree is unhealthy. There are plenty of signs to look out for when trying to spot girdling roots, such as a thinning of the trunk, an early or unhealthy leaf drop, or visible, small roots just above the soil. If you see any of these symptoms, you may have girdled tree roots stunting your tree’s potential.

## Solving Girdling Issues in Tree Roots

Remedying tree root girdling is a process that begins when the tree is planted. To prevent girdling tree roots, try some of the following preventative measures when planting your tree:

-   Plant your tree in an appropriately sized hole.
-   Remove any possible obstructions from your tree’s potential root path.
-   Monitor your trees while in planting boxes, not leaving them for too long.

If your grown tree has girdling roots long after you’ve planted it, it may be time for an arboreal expert to step in. Because trees get girdling roots from obstructions in their initial planting environment, learning how to fix girdling tree roots involves learning proper transplanting and planting procedures.
