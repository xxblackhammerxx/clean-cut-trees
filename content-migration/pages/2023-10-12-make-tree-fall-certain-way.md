Learning how to make a tree fall a certain way is a skill that develops with experience. In this post, Clean Cuts Trees, your reliable [tree cutting service company](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/layton-ut-tree-service/), explains how to maximize the chances of the tree falling as it should. 

## Felling a Tree the Right Way

We must start with a caveat here. You should always hire professionals to fell large trees. Even if you’re an expert at [pruning](https://extension.psu.edu/pruning-landscape-trees) or other tree care tasks, you’re still dealing with a tree that weighs a lot. One cut on the wrong side of the tree will bring it crashing down. Furthermore, you’re unlikely to have the proper safety equipment.

### Estimate the Felling Zone 

How tall is the tree? The answer is probably taller than you think, so allow for extra room to accommodate the top of the tree. 

### Clear the Cutting Zone and Create an Escape Route

Estimate where you think the tree will fall and clear that area by cutting away brush and removing any moveable items. If there’s a chance it’ll fall on power lines, hire a professional. 

Next, set up your escape routes. You need two clear paths at a 45-degree angle to the tree. They should both lead in opposite directions and allow you to run out of the way. 

### Check the Tree’s Infrastructure

Does it lean naturally or have heavy branches on one side more than the other? If so, that’s the way it’ll fall, so plan accordingly.  

### Cut the Notch

Your first lesson in how to make a tree fall a certain way is to carefully place the bottom cut. Cut a V-shape into the tree so that it extends about a fifth of the way into the trunk. You’ll want this cut on the side you want the tree to fall towards. 

### Use a Wedge

For a tree with a diameter of over 18 inches, we insert a wedge in between the cut and the chainsaw. This stops the tree from rocking back onto the blade and trapping it. Remove the wedges after you remove the saw. 

### Make the Final Cut

Now, make your way to the opposite side of the tree and line up your cut line with the tip of the notch. Cut through and remove the saw as soon as the tree starts to lean. Stop the saw from running and move away quickly using your escape route. 

We always have a team member watching how the tree falls to see if it falls in the correct direction. If you don’t have someone to assist, keep an eye on the tree as you walk away.
