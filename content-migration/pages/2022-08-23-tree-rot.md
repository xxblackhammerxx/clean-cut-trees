Tree rot is a common problem in homeowners’ gardens and landscapes. It can occur when a tree’s wood gets wet, cold, or both, leading to dead branches and compromised health. The causes of tree rot can vary, but the most common ones are moisture damage from heavy rain or snowfall or prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. 

While many homeowners face this issue, it can be challenging to learn how to address or prevent the issue effectively. In this article, we’ll discuss the most common causes of tree rot and provide tips for avoiding the problem on your property. If you need additional help, you can contact the **[tree service professionals in Syracuse](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/syracuse-ut-tree-service/)** at Clean Cuts Trees at [**801-473-7548**](tel:8014737548) anytime for rapid assistance at an affordable price.

## **What Causes Tree Rot?**

Moisture damage is one of the most common causes of tree rot. Wet trees can become vulnerable to fungi and insects that cause decay, including the need for [**boring insects treatment**](https://cleancutstrees.com/2024/01/12/tree-boring-insects/), as these pests often target weakened or rotting trees. In addition, water often accumulates in the shallow roots of healthy trees, damaging them when water seeps up from the ground beneath. 

Some trees are more prone to moisture-related problems, such as dogwood, cherry, walnut, and maple trees. Another common cause of tree rot is cold weather. As temperatures drop in the fall, the water content inside a tree decreases.

Dry air allows the sap inside the trunk to evaporate, leading to tree structure problems. This drying can also cause the infected trees to become more vulnerable to pests like insects and fungal diseases. So, if you’ve noticed your trees showing signs of rot recently, it’s essential to take steps to prevent the condition from worsening.

## **How to Prevent Tree Rot**

It is critical to address tree rot as soon as possible. However, it’s usually possible to prevent the disease from taking hold in the first place by taking a few simple steps. Here are some tips for avoiding tree rot in your landscape:

-    Water your trees regularly. The more hydrated your trees are, the less likely they are to develop problems with dry rot.
-    Avoid watering your trees late in the day, as doing so can cause roots to remain wet overnight and increase the risk of root rot.
-    Keep the area around your trees clear of debris, which can cause fungal growth in the soil around the base of your trees, leading to fungal disease.
-    Don’t prune your trees in the middle of the day, as improper pruning can allow bacteria to spread from the pruning wounds and increase the risk of infection.
-    Clean up fallen leaves and debris around the tree trunk at least twice a year, using a rake or leaf blower to remove excess leaves and twigs.

If you’re concerned about the health of your trees, you should hire a professional to inspect them regularly. When you need tree services in Syracuse, you can always count on Clean Cuts Trees.
