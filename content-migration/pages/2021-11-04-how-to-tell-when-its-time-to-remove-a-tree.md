The average lifespan of a tree is difficult to determine because various tree species can live for a wide range of years and decades. One study found that a reasonable estimate is [around 24 years](https://www.deeproot.com/blog/blog-entries/is-average-tree-lifespan-a-meaningful-number/). No matter what type of tree you have, at some point, disease, age, or another factor will require that you consider removing a tree. 

Knowing when exactly to remove a tree can be a tricky decision. You don’t want to pull a damaged tree if it can recover. We’ll cover common signs that tree removal is needed in this article. 

## The Tree Is Dead

This may seem obvious, but [determining when a tree is dead](https://cleancutstrees.com/2024/11/12/how-to-tell-if-a-tree-is-dead-or-dormant/) is not always apparent if the plant dies during fall or winter. If your tree has reached the expected lifespan for that species and it does not sprout leaves in the spring, you can make [plans for removing](https://cleancutstrees.com/service/tree-removal/) the dead tree.

A dead tree can quickly become a safety hazard. Heavy limbs could break off and fall. The entire tree will eventually fall over — possibly damaging nearby structures.  

## Tree Shows Signs of Disease

Like any plant, a tree is susceptible to infection from fungus and pests. As the disease spreads, the tree can weaken to the point where branches become unstable. 

Even if a tree has a [slow-progressing disease](https://arbordayblog.org/treecare/identify-tree-ailments/), the appearance of a diseased tree can diminish your home’s curb appeal. To improve the appearance of your landscaping and potentially prevent falling debris, you may need to look for tree removal services to pull the damaged tree. 

## There Is Risk to Your Home

Trees have notoriously strong roots that can lift and damage large structures over time. There are situations when you may need to consider [removing a tree](https://cleancutstrees.com/everything-you-should-know-about-hiring-a-tree-removal-service/) if the roots are too close to your home. Burst pipes and cracked foundations are just a few of the problems that can occur when a tree’s roots are allowed to grow under your home. 

## The Tree Blocks a View

Sometimes, the location of a tree can become a nuisance. Do you sit on your back patio and wish that a large tree didn’t block your view of the broader outdoors? The location of your tree may also cast shade that makes it difficult to grow grass.

## Factors to Consider Before You Remove a Tree

Before you decide to remove a tree, you’ll need to consider several factors. Some species of trees are protected. Heritage trees may be protected due to their age, size, and species. 

You may also need permission from your neighborhood homeowner association. If you have questions about the status of your tree, the team at Clean Cuts Trees can help you determine whether your tree is safe to remove.
