## Choose the Right Planting Site

An expert service helps you choose the ideal site to plant the tree in your home.

In choosing a planting site, it’s important to check on the type of tree, its mature size, adjacent trees, and the home’s position. It’s also important to check on water sources and powerlines.

To choose the perfect site, let an expert handle the task.

## Necessary Equipment and Techniques

Do you have the necessary [tree planting](https://www.southernliving.com/home-garden/gardens/tree-planting) tools? Without proper planting tools, you are likely to damage tree roots when transporting. The right tools will lift, carry and deposit the tree gently into the ground without causing any damage to the tree roots.

Also, a professional knows the dos and don’ts in the process.

## Check the Type of Soil 

When determining on best site to plan trees, an expert will first test the soil.
