Tree boring insects, also known as wood borers, destroy plenty of ornamental trees and shrubs in the United States and beyond. Most borers belong to the larvae stage of various insect groups, including beetles, wasps, and moths.   

Regardless of the type, you need to eliminate tree borers quickly to save the infested tree. As [Riverdale’s tree service](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/riverdale-ut-tree-service/) of choice, Clean Cuts Trees delves deeper into how to treat and prevent tree borer infestations.  

## Detecting Tree Boring Insects  

Borers will rarely attack healthy trees growing in their natural environments. Instead, they prefer newly transplanted, injured, or stressed trees. Once young larvae hatch, they quickly tunnel beneath the bark, where they feed and grow.  

Stay alert for tunnel holes, frass, dead limbs, cracked bark, or oozing sap. Once inside the tree, you’ll barely detect borer larvae until they do serious damage, often characterized by structural weakness, girdling, branch dieback, and overall decline that may eventually kill the entire tree.  

Infestation sites also provide entry points for pathogens. By this time, the larvae will no longer succumb to insecticide sprays.  

Common types of wood borers include:  

-   Flat-headed borers like the flat-headed apple tree borer and emerald ash borer 
-   Round-headed borers like longhorn beetles  
-   Weevils like the white pine weevil  
-   Wood-boring moth caterpillars like the peachtree borer  

## How To Treat and Manage Tree Boring Insects  

Once you confirm that you have a tree boring infestation on your hands, you can use two treatment options.  

### 1\. Chemical  

Contact insecticide and soil treatments can kill and prevent future infestations of certain types of tree boring insects. Different jurisdictions have varying guidelines on pesticide use, so ensure you can legally use a pesticide before applying it to your trees.  

### 2\. Mechanical  

Alternatively, you could remove larvae from the tree with a tool or remove infested wood. In case of a severe infestation, you may need to remove the entire tree to mitigate the risk of falling branches or widespread infestation.  

## Preventing Tree Borer Infestations  

Consider the following proactive approaches to preventing wood borer infestations.

### Choose the Right Tree Species  

When choosing trees to plant in your yard, go for species that wood borers rarely attack. A certified arborist or tree care expert can advise you on less susceptible tree species for your area. 

### Ensure Proper Tree Care  

Since tree boring insects primarily target stressed or weak trees, properly watering and [fertilizing your trees](https://pressbooks.lib.vt.edu/treesteward/chapter/9/) may lower the risk of infestation. Remember to take care of newly transplanted trees as well. 

### Prevent and Care for Tree Injuries  

Injuries make your tree more susceptible to borer infestation. If you notice a wounded tree, take care of it to lower the likelihood of infestation.
