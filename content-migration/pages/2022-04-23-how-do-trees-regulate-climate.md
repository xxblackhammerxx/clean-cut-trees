Everyone has heard that planting trees can help combat climate change and improve air quality. But what many don’t know is how trees provide short-term and long-term environmental benefits. So, exactly how do trees help regulate the climate? 

Trees and their leaves are responsible for filtering out and sometimes upcycling specific components of our atmosphere. The more trees we plant, the better our chances of reducing greenhouse gas concentrations and having cleaner, safer air. 

Tree planting and upkeep don’t have to be a hassle. We have a team of experienced arborists ready to assist you. Contact your local and trusted **[emergency tree removal in Kaysville by Clean Cuts Trees](https://cleancutstrees.com/services/emergency-tree-damage/)** for information about healthy tree planting methods, tree species recommendations, and more. 

## **Trees and Carbon Dioxide Absorption** 

Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to the rise in global temperature. Trees absorb this harmful gas, removing it from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. 

Photosynthesis is how trees make their energy, and is a complex process involving sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. Tree planting helps restore tree populations displaced or damaged by urban development, increasing the amount of photosynthesis and carbon dioxide filtration that takes place. 

With CO2 emissions rising, finding a cost-effective option that slows down climate change is essential. Trees absorb CO2 as they grow, and planting them is a simple act that anyone can participate in to fight the climate crisis. Trees also benefit wildlife, reduce water pollution, and combat soil erosion. 

## **How Planting Trees Helps Reduce Energy Costs**  

How do trees regulate the climate and reduce energy costs? All parts of the tree play their role in reducing greenhouse gasses. From their leaves, roots, and vastness, trees can help reduce the amount of energy needed to cool and heat your home or business. 

Leaf canopies aid in lowering the temperature through transpiration and evaporation, also known as evapotranspiration. This process releases moisture into the air by taking the water from bodies of water, the soil, and pavement and converting it to vapor. 

When the outside ambient temperature is lower, the energy needed to cool your home decreases. In addition to this, planting trees strategically around your home or business can help reduce your utility bills. 

When the temperature outside is cooler, your heating system will not have to work as hard to warm your home. When the trees lose their leaves, more direct sunlight enters your house, reducing energy costs.
