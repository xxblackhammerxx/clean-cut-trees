Each year, autumn brings a bit of a twilight zone for property owners. You look across your lawn to that sapling you planted in the spring. Did it survive the summer? Has it entered a healthy dormancy? 

Clean Cut Trees, a [qualified tree service in Bountiful, UT](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/bountiful-ut-tree-service/), explains how to tell if a tree is dead or dormant below. Put your worries to rest and find out once and for all with our expert tips.

## What’s the Difference Between Dormancy and Death?

Some property owners don’t realize that [plant diversity impacts biodiversity](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.19011) in local ecosystems. Accidentally removing a dormant tree could negatively impact insect populations and other nearby wildlife. When you understand the differences between death and dormancy, you can make informed decisions about managing your outdoor spaces. 

A dormant tree might look the same as a dead tree on the surface, but trees entering a dormant state are still very much alive. This winter resting state simply encourages root health and growth. Autumn’s hallmark leaf drop allows the trees to divert their resources underground as winter approaches.

## Learn How To Tell if a Tree Is Dead or Dormant

So, do you want to know how to tell if a tree is dead or dormant in your yard? Firstly, know that you often can’t tell by looking at the specimen. You must use your other senses to identify signs of life lurking out of view. 

### What Season Is It?

Most trees go dormant in the fall. You’ll notice color changes from the leaves as each tree cuts its water and nutrient supply. Then, the leaves will fall one by one.

Evergreens are the exception to the rule. They stay green and continue growing year-round. If you notice pine trees losing needles, contact an arborist. 

### Look for Leaf Buds

You can also determine whether a tree is dormant or dead by checking its bud viability. Once a specimen drops its leaves, it develops tiny buds at the tips of each branch. Those buds come to life in spring, replacing the fallen leaves. 

Examine the limbs within your reach. Leaf buds are small, dark, and rounded, and you’ll need to look closely.

### Inspect the Bark

The bark condition is another tell-tale sign to gauge tree health. Note the following:

-   Trees with stripped bark and exposed heartwood need help from an arborist.
-   Is the bark intact? Does the exposed heartwood look hydrated and fresh? The tree is probably alive, well, and healing. 

If the bark looks stripped and the trunk shows no signs of regrowth, the tree might be dead.

### Check the Branches

Finally, test the limbs for branch flexibility and hydration. 

Twigs on a dead tree will effortlessly snap off. The wood should feel dry. 

If the branch resists breakage and feels moist once fractured, the tree’s tissues are healthy.
