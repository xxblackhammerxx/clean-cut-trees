Though most trees grow up and out, sometimes they can develop a lean. The unique shape and stature of the plant might give it a slight aesthetic value, but some tilts create serious safety hazards. So how far can a tree lean before it falls?

As [Layton’s superior tree service specialists](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/layton-ut-tree-service/), our Clean Cuts Trees crew prioritizes the safety of community members and their property. As such, we understand leaning tree dangers and the risks they pose. Keep reading to learn more about tree lean limits and when to call the professionals for help.

## Common Explanations for Tree Tilting

Since [trees](https://warnell.uga.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/What%20is%20a%20tree%20ARBOR-06.pdf) are plants that adapt to their environments, they sometimes grow at a slight angle instead of sprouting vertically. When a tree grows naturally with a tilt, it usually isn’t a danger to people or property. The problem comes from trees that start off with straight trunks but develop a tilt later due to an outside influence like a severe storm, high winds, or soil erosion. 

## What’s the Maximum Tree Lean Angle?

How far can a tree lean before it falls? The average tree stability threshold is about a 15% lean in any direction from its vertical growth.

When trees develop a steeper angle than that, it usually indicates a serious problem. Without immediate intervention from a professional tree care service, the tree could topple. 

## Why a Leaning Tree Is Dangerous

The last thing you want is a massive tree to fall in your yard. Strong or consistent winds could cause the tree to fall, leading to major property damage or injuries. In the worst-case scenario, you could be liable if you fail to remedy a leaning tree on your property and it falls, causing injury or damage to another person or their property. 

## Signs It’s Time to Remove a Tiltled Tree

Despite knowing how far a tree can tilt before it falls, a leaning tree could fall seemingly out of nowhere if you don’t know what to look for. Instead of ignoring the trees around your landscape, remember these warning signs of a tilted tree that needs immediate attention:

-   A leaning angle greater than 15-degrees
-   A tilt that worsens over time
-   A sudden lean following a bad storm 
-   Exposed tree roots or cracked soil around the base of the tree

Your tree likely won’t grow straight after forming a lean but tree cabling can provide the necessary stability to minimize hazards.
