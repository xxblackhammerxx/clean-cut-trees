![5 Effective Ways To Preserve Trees in Clinton, UT](https://cleancutstrees.com/wp-content/uploads/tree-preservation-1080x600.jpg)

Trees are highly valuable to the quality of our life. It’s extremely important that we take steps to protect them. However, it’s all too common for people to feel too far removed from efforts to ensure we don’t lose the lungs of the earth.

As the top provider of [tree services in Clinton, UT](https://cleancutstrees.com/service-areas/clinton-ut-tree-service/), we can tell you that tree preservation is our collective responsibility. We’ll look at five ways we can all contribute to preserving trees and our ecosystem.

## **1\. Adhere to Tree Conservation Guidelines**

[Tree conservation efforts](https://www.nationalforests.org/blog/tree-planting-impacts-you-heres-why) are mostly about maintaining and protecting existing trees. Various bodies and communities have rules in place to protect green spaces around us and trees growing in the wild in the forest. You can do your part by following any laid down guidelines and making sure other people around you are doing the same.

## **2\. Protect Heritage Trees**

Just like heritage houses, heritage trees are those trees that have significant historical or cultural value. These trees need special care and protection.

If you have any of these around your community, you can do your part to ensure they are identified by the local government and then also protect them from people who may not know about their status.

So, that 200-year-old oak tree in the local park isn’t the right choice for target practice during neighborhood games!

The designation will also qualify these trees for various protection measures ranging from fencing during construction, banning the use of heavy machinery around it, and having strict penalties for inflicting damage on them.

## **3\. Emphasize Root Zone Care**

A tree is only as healthy as its roots. Protecting the root zone, therefore, is one of the best approaches to tree preservation. Common steps to protect the root zone include mulching, keeping heavy machinery away from the area to prevent compaction, managing water runoff to prevent root decay, and protecting the zone during construction.

## **4\. Improve Soil Health**

All trees need healthy soil to thrive. Tree preservation efforts will be a lot easier if more people try to improve soil health within their domain.

Some of the approaches you can take include mixing in organic composts, avoiding the use of harmful chemicals, regularly checking pH levels for possible rebalancing, and reducing activities that can have a severe environmental impact.

## **5\. Be Proactive Against Pests and Diseases**

Pests and diseases have caused mass tree casualties countless times around Clinton, UT. Regularly inspecting trees for any signs of pests and diseases and treating any issues can save dozens of trees around the area.
