“Why is my tree not growing leaves?” 

In this post, our team at Clean Cuts Trees, your source for **[trusted tree removal in Kaysville, UT](https://cleancutstrees.com/services/tree-removal/)**, explains that this may be one of the **[problems diseases cause](https://www.uaex.uada.edu/environment-nature/forestry/health/disease-problems.aspx)**, but not always. 

## Late Blooming

We are accustomed to seeing trees sprout leaves in spring, so not seeing those leaves grow is distressing. It’s also perfectly normal for species like the Black Walnut and Crape Myrtle to start leafing out in early summer. 

This is not due to an ailment but rather a quirk of the species.  We recommend identifying your tree correctly before you panic. If you find out it leafs out in spring, give it a couple of weeks before you call the professionals. 

Trees can come out of dormancy later than they should for many reasons, very few of which are fatal. 

## Fungal Diseases

Another answer to the question, “Why is my tree not growing leaves?” is a fungal disease like verticillium wilt.  Look for signs of wilting and a general lack of vigor. In addition to not growing leaves, the tree might have abnormal growths or soft patches. 

These diseases are rife when the weather starts to warm up, so check your trees carefully for symptoms. If you see signs of any disease, you must act quickly. 

Professional arborists can help with the right solution before the damage is irreversible. They can also offer proactive measures to protect vulnerable plants from a range of infections and [**diseases in trees**](https://cleancutstrees.com/2024/07/12/what-are-the-signs-of-ash-tree-disease/).

Call your local tree company if you have Maple ornamental trees, oak trees, dogwoods, or sycamores to protect against serious infections like anthracnose. Tree experts know you don’t want to use chemicals unless you have to, but this is one case where a preventive fungal spray is worthwhile. 

## Lack of Resources

Another reason for a tree not to produce leaves is a lack of resources. Trees won’t start growing if they don’t have the nutrients or water to do so. A lack of water will be more obvious, with the branches and twigs wilting. 

In times of drought, fixing this issue is difficult. To make it easier for the tree to hold onto moisture, mulch the area between the trunk and drip line. 

It’s trickier to spot nutrient deficiencies, especially as these often show in the leaf color. The main sign is an overall lack of vitality. To be sure, conduct a soil test to see if the soil lacks any vital nutrients, and consider **[deep root fertilization](https://cleancutstrees.com/2024/04/12/deep-root-fertilization/)** to provide the necessary nutrients for healthy growth. Mulching is also useful in adding back nutrients.

## What to Do Next? 

When you figure out why your tree is bare, you can take the appropriate steps to remedy the situation. If you’re not sure, call a local arborist. In the meantime, do everything you can to improve your tree’s health.
