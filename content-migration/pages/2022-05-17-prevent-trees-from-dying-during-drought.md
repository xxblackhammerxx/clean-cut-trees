Dry soil and high temperatures can significantly impact the lifespan of your landscape trees. Considering that Utah is one of the driest states in the country, with a desert climate, it is essential to take measures to prevent your trees dying from drought. 

Utah landowners are accustomed to the local weather and know the consequences of not watering enough throughout the hot summer days. However, when drought kills some of the trees, locals turn to our **[tree removal services in Kaysville](https://cleancutstrees.com/services/tree-removal/)**.

## **5 Ways to Prevent Your Trees Dying From Drought in Kaysville, Utah**

Luckily, there are a few ways to protect the old and valuable trees in your backyard and [**preserve**](https://cleancutstrees.com/2025/02/12/tree-preservation-effective-methods/) the natural shade during a drought in Kaysville, Utah.

### **1\. Install a Thick Mulch Layer**

If one or more of your trees is growing in turf, removing the current lawn and adding a thick mulch layer is essential to avoid water loss. Throughout the year, your tree and turfgrass compete for moisture and nutrients. Grass can absorb the irrigation water before it reaches the tree’s roots. 

If you remove the turf around the tree, you will allow it to receive more water and nutrients to survive the drought.

### **2\. Check Trees Regularly**

Leaf drip, a sparse canopy, undersized leaves, yellowing, and premature fall coloration are early symptoms of trees dying from drought. Therefore, it is essential to check your trees regularly to ensure they receive enough water and additional nutrients. 

When you treat the symptoms early, it is easier to prevent significant damage and possible tree removal.

### **3\. Deep Water Your Trees**

Trees need water to survive. So, during the summers in Kaysville, Utah, it’s essential to deep water your trees. 

You can move water in the trees through individual cells and conductive tissues with vascular water transport. Water from the soil enters the tree’s root hairs and moves along into the xylem.

### **4\. Consider Soil Injections**

When the temperatures are high, you need to try everything to protect your landscape trees. Soil injections are an excellent way to provide moisture to the tree’s roots. 

These injections also stimulate photosynthesis in leaves, a process by which they use sunlight to absorb food and water.

### **5\. Prune the Tree’s Canopy**

Another way to prevent trees dying from drought is to prune the canopy and reduce weak branches and excess foliage. You should also remove dying or dead limbs as they may attract insects and pests that can contribute to stress and diseases.
