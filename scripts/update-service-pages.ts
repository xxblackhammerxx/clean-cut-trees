- **Fruit Trees**: Coordinating with fruiting seasons

### Species-Specific Timing
Different tree species have optimal pruning windows:
- **Oak Trees**: Best pruned during dormant season to prevent oak wilt
- **Fruit Trees**: Late winter pruning for optimal fruit production
- **Flowering Trees**: Prune after blooming to preserve next year's flowers
- **Evergreens**: Can be pruned year-round but late spring is often best
- **Deciduous Trees**: Dormant season generally provides best results
